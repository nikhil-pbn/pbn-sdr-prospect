/**
 * Prisma client singleton.
 *
 * Two things this has to get right:
 *
 *  1. In dev, Next.js hot-reloads modules on every edit. Constructing a client
 *     per reload exhausts the Postgres connection pool within a few minutes, so
 *     the instance is cached on globalThis.
 *  2. Construction is LAZY. `next build` imports server modules while
 *     prerendering, and DATABASE_URL is not necessarily present at build time —
 *     eager construction would fail the build. The client is created on first
 *     query instead, with a readable error if the URL is missing.
